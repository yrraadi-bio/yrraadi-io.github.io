                    <p class="blog-date">September 29, 2025</p>

                    <p>We're excited to announce Origin, the first AI model that generates regulatory DNA sequences and
                        also predicts function. So far, DNA models have been restricted to natively perform either
                        DNA-to-DNA, DNA-to-function or function-to-DNA tasks. Axis is the first to unify all three
                        capabilities.</p>

                        have delivered deep and sometimes long-lasting remissions in otherwise refractory B-cell
                        malignancies.</p>

                    <p>Alongside these advances, the field still faces three persistent challenges: limited efficacy,
                        immune/toxicity events, and off-tissue activity. In CAR-T specifically, <a

                        can drive tonic signaling and T-cell exhaustion, undermining persistence and antitumor
                            activity. In AAV programs, <a

                    <p>This is exactly where promoter and enhancer optimization can help. In CAR-T, moving from <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8027690/"

                    <p>The success of this paradigm in the natural language processing domain was an initial motivation
                        behind our pursuit of a multifunctional DNA model. With Origin, we report that training a model
                        to generate DNA sequences at a high resolution also improved the model's ability to predict the
                        function of existing DNA sequences. We're excited about the implications of this</p>

                    <h2>Gene Regulation &amp; Mechanical Control</h2>

                    <p>
                        An epigenetic code governs the accessibility of DNA, allowing proteins called transcription factors to bind to specific sites. This, in turn, switches on different genes within the DNA. The epigenetic code and the availability of these proteins differ from cell type to cell type, among other factors. As a result, different genes are expressed in nerve cells versus skin cells, giving them their distinct functions and identities.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        AI-designed regulatory sequences can enable precise control. TF-binding prompts let you specify promoters or enhancers by the transcription factors available in a given cell state or cell type, biasing gene expression where those factors are active and lowering exposure elsewhere. As specification expands—from binary binding to relative motif weights, excluded TFs, and simple logic (e.g., "A and B, not C")—the model can jointly tune level and specificity, pushing toward safer, more durable expression profiles that relieve poor efficacy, immune pressure, and off-tissue activity.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Axis, when prompted with different transcription factors, will generate a regulatory sequence with a high likelihood of enabling the specified transcription factors to bind. One indication of this ability is the presence of short nucleotide sequences (~8–10 characters long) called "motifs" that act as binding sites. Most transcription factor proteins have a unique motif that they recognize.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For every transcription factor the model was trained on, we prompted it to generate sequences with the intended binding of that transcription factor (Set A), and then asked it to generate sequences without explicit prompting of that same transcription factor (Set B). We observed clear motif enrichment—sequences from Set A had up to 14× more occurrences of the protein’s consensus motif compared to Set B. This shows that not only did the model learn the distinct role of these sequences, but that it is also capable of following instructions.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>Exploring larger design spaces</h2>

                    <p>Generative models that learn the rules of transcription factor (TF) binding open up new ways to control and program gene therapies. Natural genomes only explore a fraction of the possible combinations of TF motifs, but synthetic design can uncover novel interactions and explore this design space. By capturing these rules, the model can not only design functional enhancers but also emulate circuit-like logic - starting from single TF binding site effects and extending to combinatorial interactions between multiple TF motifs for greater specificity and complexity.</p>

                    <p>Here we convey intuition of the basic kind of programmability we envision using analogies of circuits. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867425004490?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=98767e9cbd27a365" target="_blank">Recent work</a> demonstrates TF motif interactions that inspired the circuit interpretation shown below.</p>

                    <h2>Single-TF motif circuits:</h2>

                    <p>These are control circuits that can arise from the presence of binding sites of single
                        transcription factors on a regulatory sequence (e.g., enhancers).</p>

                    <h4 class="blog-subheading">Switch</h4>
                    <p>Enhancer sequences containing motifs for certain single transcription factors (TF) show
                        switch-like behavior: they are active in certain cell states but silent or repressed in others.
                        This demonstrates that even a single motif can encode selective control, providing
                        cell-state-specific activity rather than a universal effect. Intuitively, it's similar to a
                        switch that turns on only in particular rooms, highlighting how basic motif designs can already
                        achieve targeted expression.</p>

                    <h2>About the Model & Data</h2>

                    <p>Our model architecture employs a shared Transformer backbone for the DNA generation and assay
                        prediction tasks. Nucleotide and assay heads diverge after the final Transformer layer with some
                        additional processing specific to the assay prediction in-between. Cell type and the prompts
                        (regulatory type such as promoter + transcription factor proteins) are tokenized and appended to
                        the input DNA sequence. The final loss is a linear combination of the cross-entropy for nucleotide prediction with a factorized poisson and multinomial loss to capture the profile and intensity of the regulatory region.</p>

                    <p>The source of the training data is ENCODE. We use intervals of independent cis-regulatory elements (CREs) from the ENCODE V4 Registry found on the SCREEN page. CREs are ranked by their mean activity and we derive a z-score ranking for every biosample and assay combination. CREs are then split into train and test scaffolds and we verify that there is no overlap of genomic coordinates in order to ensure zero contamination in the data used for benchmarking. Our data processing pipeline of the actual experimental files is identical to what is done and reported in the AlphaGenome paper.</p>

                    <p>AlphaGenome is not robust to the distributional shift that occurs when the context window reduces from during training, suggesting difficulty with understanding local context features and an overreliance on long range patterns. Interestingly, even when AlphaGenome is given ~1000x more nucleotide context than Axis, Axis reaches 95% of AlphaGenome's performance on these benchmarks.</p>

                    <h2>Call for Lab Testing</h2>

                    <p>Our immediate focus is on testing out the model’s generated sequences in a wet-lab setting before publicly releasing the model. We are also interested in sharing access to the model via a free API to academic labs in order to get feedback. If you belong to a lab and are interested in either the wet-lab testing or trying out the model, please fill the form (here).</p>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                    <p>Imagine having to use one ChatGPT for translating text and another for captioning images. This reality, where there were marginalized models for different tasks was not far away from materializing. A conscious effort to explore the benefits of multi-task learning eventually paved the way for today’s technology. One such work was “Multi-task sequence-to-sequence learning” by the Google Brain team. The work reported that training a model to caption images also improved translation quality between English and German. This would serve as one of the many precursors to the language models of today, with one of the paper’s authors, Ilya Sutskever, going on to create the first GPT. </p>

                    <p>The success of this paradigm in the natural language processing domain was an initial motivation behind our pursuit of a multifunctional DNA model. With Axis, we report that training a model to generate DNA sequences at a high resolution also improved the model’s ability to predict the function of existing DNA sequences. We’re excited about the implications of this.</p>

                    <div class="blog-image">
                        <img src="assets/alphagenome/22.png" alt="AlphaGenome illustration" loading="lazy" />

                    </div>
                    
                    <p>We’re excited about the implications of this and believe that Axis is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to how promptable and unifiedmodels can and should be. Unified not just across functions within one domain like DNA, but across RNA, proteins and cellular representations. We believe a fundamental reason behind the lack of reliability and impact of today’s models is underspecification of the whole system. Biology is incredibly complex and in constant coordination - we must make AI models that learn to compress and reason over the whole puzzle and not just pieces of it. Completing this grand challenge can unlock a new era of developing therapies that are capable of addressing highly complex diseases, making human lives infinitely better. </p>

                    <p>If this work excites you and you want to dedicate your time and effort to tackling this problem with us, please reach out at hiring@origin.bio. We’re looking for exceptional engineers.</p>
